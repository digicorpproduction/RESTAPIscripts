REST API Scripts

Create a Box Developer account and create a new Box Application to obtain a client ID and client secret.

Create a PowerShell script with the following content:
Replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET', and 'doej@yourdomain.com' with your actual Box App settings, AD User details, and email address.

Run the script. The script will create a Box account for the AD user and a "Home" folder in the newly created Box account.

Please note that this is a simplified script, and error handling should be added to ensure a more robust solution.
